                    CT Guided Biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that uses CT imaging to precisely guide a needle to obtain tissue samples 
                    from suspicious areas within the body. It is commonly used for diagnosing cancers, infections, or other abnormalities. 
                    The procedure offers high accuracy, reducing the risk of complications and ensuring the correct tissue is sampled. 
                    It is particularly useful when the abnormality is located deep within the body or in difficult-to-reach areas. 
                    CT-guided biopsy is often preferred due to its ability to provide real-time imaging, allowing for precise targeting of tissue 
                    and minimizing the need for larger surgical procedures.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                CT Guided Biopsy is an advanced, minimally invasive diagnostic procedure that combines the detailed imaging capabilities of a CT scan with the precision of a biopsy needle. This procedure allows healthcare providers to obtain tissue samples from areas within the body that are difficult to access, such as deep-seated tumors or lesions in the lungs, liver, kidneys, or lymph nodes. Using real-time CT imaging, the physician can accurately guide the needle to the precise location of the abnormality, ensuring that the correct tissue is sampled.
            </p>
            <p>
                The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, meaning that patients remain awake and comfortable during the process. The CT scan provides continuous imaging guidance, allowing the doctor to adjust the needle's position as needed. This is particularly useful when the target area is surrounded by vital organs or other sensitive structures, where traditional biopsy methods may be too risky. By minimizing the need for large surgical incisions, CT-guided biopsy is associated with shorter recovery times and reduced risk of complications.
            </p>
            <p>
                CT-guided biopsy is commonly used to diagnose a range of conditions, including cancers, infections, and benign abnormalities such as cysts or masses. It is especially valuable in oncology, where tissue samples are essential for determining the type and stage of cancer, which helps guide treatment decisions. The procedure also plays a crucial role in diagnosing infections, as it can identify the presence of abscesses or inflammatory conditions in organs.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the significant advantages of CT-guided biopsy is its ability to target lesions in areas that are otherwise challenging to reach with conventional biopsy methods, such as the deep lungs, retroperitoneal spaces, or other areas surrounded by critical structures. The real-time imaging also ensures that the sample is collected from the correct part of the tissue, increasing the accuracy and reliability of the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                The procedure typically takes about 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the complexity and location of the target tissue. After the biopsy, patients are monitored for a short period to ensure there are no immediate complications, such as bleeding or infection. While the risk of complications is low, patients may experience mild discomfort or soreness at the biopsy site for a few days. The tissue samples obtained are then sent to a laboratory for analysis, which can provide valuable insights into the underlying health condition.
