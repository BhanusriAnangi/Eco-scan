                    Mammography is a specialized imaging technique used to examine the breast tissue. It uses low-dose X-rays to detect early signs of breast cancer and other abnormalities, helping with early diagnosis and treatment planning. Mammograms can reveal tumors or abnormalities that are too small to be felt through physical examination, making them crucial for early detection. 
                    This non-invasive procedure typically involves the compression of the breast to spread the tissue, which helps provide clearer images. 
                    Mammography is a key screening tool for women, especially those over 40 or with a family history of breast cancer. 
                    In addition to cancer detection, it can also identify cysts, calcifications, and benign tumors that may require further evaluation. 
                    Regular mammograms are recommended as part of routine healthcare for early detection, which greatly improves the chances of successful treatment and recovery.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Mammography is a crucial diagnostic and screening tool used for detecting breast cancer and other breast abnormalities. It involves the use of low-dose X-rays to capture detailed images of the breast tissue, allowing healthcare professionals to identify any irregularities that may indicate the presence of breast cancer, benign tumors, cysts, or calcifications. This procedure is particularly important for detecting early-stage breast cancer, often before symptoms or lumps can be felt, significantly increasing the chances of successful treatment and recovery. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The mammography procedure typically involves the compression of the breast between two plates, which helps to spread the tissue out evenly for clearer imaging. This compression can be uncomfortable but is essential for obtaining high-quality images that reduce the amount of radiation exposure. The resulting images are examined by radiologists who can detect abnormal growths, irregularities, and subtle changes in breast tissue. Mammograms are typically performed annually or biannually for women aged 40 and above, though younger women or those with a family history of breast cancer may need to start screening earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to detecting breast cancer, mammography is also valuable in diagnosing other non-cancerous breast conditions, such as fibroadenomas (benign tumors), cysts, and signs of infection or inflammation. It can also be used to assess the effectiveness of treatment in patients who have previously been diagnosed with breast cancer. Mammograms are a non-invasive and relatively quick procedure, and they remain one of the most effective tools in reducing breast cancer mortality rates through early detection and timely intervention. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Regular mammography screening, especially for those in higher risk categories, has been shown to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality. In combination with clinical breast exams and self-exams, mammography remains the gold standard in breast cancer prevention.
